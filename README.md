This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Project Titan Collaboration Guidelines

Prereq: clone the repo first

1. pull the latest main branch: ```git pull origin main```
2. create new topic branch to develop your feature/change: ```git branch checkout -b <my-branch-name>```
3. do work; make your local commit(s): ```git commit```
4. push your commits to your branch to create the pull request: ```git push origin <my-branch-name>```
5. goto https://github.com/project-titan-org/prototype and you should be able to finish creating your PR
5. tag team @dev to review the PR; one approval is all you need to merge your code
